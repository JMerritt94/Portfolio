<p class="aboutme"> <img class="rounded headshot" src="assets/images/linked in photo.jpg"  width="150" height="200" align="left"> My name is Jay Merritt and I recently graduated from the Trinity Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp at the University of North Carolina Charlotte. I have two bachelors degrees in Political Science and Phillosophy
    from the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill.  I am currently looking for work in web development and working on certain coding projects for fun. My hobbies other include cooking, weightlifting, basketball, video games,
    and watching films.

    <p class="aboutme">
    I first learned to code in college by taking courses in Matlab. While I ended up going in a different direction with my education, I really enjoyed coding and the idea 
    of creating code. What really appealed to me about coding is that is has both mathematic and creative sides to it. When the opportunity to take this web development class at UNCC emerged I was energized 
    to learn a new and useful skill. During the class we learned how to code HTML, CSS, Javascript(es5&6), and used technologies 
    such as Express, Express-Handlebars, and React.js. We learned how to operate databases with MYSQL and Mongodb. These skills have prepared me to pursue a career in web deveoplemt.

<p class=" aboutme h4 text-center">Future Plans</p>
<p class="aboutme">

I am currently working on a cooking app in React in order to help my React skills. The next two languages I would like to learn are Python and Matlab.
