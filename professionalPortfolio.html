                      started to realize the importance of clean code and how to make your code short and concise. It also introduced me to classic
                      coding problems like scoping and how to avoid scoping errors.

                      <p> I had lots of fun with this assignment. This was about learning how to make timers and use those timers to build websites. 
                          In this example I made a quiz about Keanu Reeves that demonstrated my knowledge of timers, radio buttons, and css. The tricky thing with 
                          this app was to make it so that it didnt count every empty radio button as an unanswered question. Bootstrap was the main resource I used for the front end.

                          <p> This app was our first assignment that had to use APIs. Users can choose from the preset buttons for searches or enter in a new animal to look up gifs for.
                               I used the Giphy API to populate the screen with gifs of what the user searches. This demonstrates my ability to make dynamic websites
                              that you can update with jquery and APIs. The front end was made with Bootstrap. </p>

                                I also used Javascript and Jquery to allow users to add trains that then update the chart. I also had lots of fun with the CSS and used bootstrap to make it. </p>

                                  to get information about artists and play their music. We used Google Firebase to have a continually updating rating system for artists. We used  materialize and bootstrap to make our front end. All in all i learned so much
                                about the process of working in a team during this project. </p>

                              <p> This was the first full stack app I made. In this app I used ES6 and Express to create an app that essentially works as a friend finding app. You fill out the survey,
                                  and when you complete the survey it adds your data to an API. Then your data is compared to the data that is hardcoded into the API to see who would be the best match for you based on your answers.
                                  For my front end I used fontawesome and bootstrap.

                           <p> For our second project I worked in a team of four that put together an Express app that can search for ski resorts from our MYSQL database of resorts based on name and state. We used firebase authentification to have users login
                               and make comments on the various resorts. I also gained experience using Heroku and JawsDB for our database. I worked with the Google maps API and the sequelize search functions for the project and learned
                               a great deal about how to integrate NPMS into a full stack app. For the front end we used Font Awesome, Bootstrap, and just basic CSS. </p>

                       <p>
                           This app uses Express, MYSQL, ES6 and Handlebars to create a dynamically updating web page that allows users to consume burgers from a menu, add new burgers to consume, and revive all of the burgers that have been eaten. 
                           The front end was done through Express Handlebars which allows me to dynamically generate front end content for each item in the MYSQL database. Learning how to generate front end content through handlebars was extremely valuable,
                           since a back end that can update a front end can be extremely useful for building apps.
